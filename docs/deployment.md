# Deployment Guide

The app is split in two:

- **Frontend** (React + Vite, in `frontend/`) -> **Vercel**
- **Backend** (Django, in `backend/`) -> **Render** (Docker web service)
- **Database** -> **Neon** (free Postgres, no credit card, no 30-day expiry)

The frontend calls `/api/*` as a relative URL. On Vercel,
`frontend/vercel.json` rewrites `/api/*` to the Render backend, so cookies
stay **same-site** and the existing session/CSRF flow works unchanged.

> Why not Render's managed Postgres? It requires a credit card and the free
> tier expires after 30 days. Neon's free tier needs no card and does not
> expire, and `?sslmode=require` in the connection string works with the
> existing `dj_database_url` setup unchanged.

## Before you start (checklist)

- [ ] Repo pushed to GitHub
- [ ] A **Neon** account and a project/database created (free, no card)
- [ ] The Neon connection string pasted into `backend/render.yaml`
      (`DATABASE_URL`, replacing `REPLACE_ME`)
- [ ] `backend/render.yaml` `repo:` points at your actual GitHub repo
      (already set to `lordvalicious/perfect-foundation-sms`)
- [ ] `backend/render.yaml` `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` matches your Vercel URL
- [ ] After the backend deploys: copy its `https://*.onrender.com` URL into
      `frontend/vercel.json` (see step 3 below)

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- The repo pushed to GitHub (e.g. `github.com/you/perfect-foundation-sms`)
- A [Vercel](https://vercel.com) account
- A [Render](https://render.com) account
- A [Neon](https://neon.tech) account

## 2. Set up the database (Neon)

1. Sign up at https://neon.tech (free, **no credit card required**).
2. Click **Create a project** (region: any, e.g. `US East`) - a database
   named `neondb` is created for you.
3. Go to **Connect** and copy the **Connection string** (URI). It looks like:
   `postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`
   (Neon includes `?sslmode=require`; keep it - the app needs SSL.)
4. Paste it into `backend/render.yaml` in place of `REPLACE_ME`:
   ```yaml
   - key: DATABASE_URL
     value: postgresql://user:pass@ep-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
   and push to GitHub. (You can also set/override it later in Render
   Dashboard -> Environment, then Redeploy.)

## 3. Deploy the backend on Render

1. In the Render dashboard: **New -> Blueprint -> New Blueprint Instance**,
   connect your repo and pick the blueprint. Render provisions only:

   - `perfect-foundation-backend` (Docker web service, **free plan**)

   No managed Postgres, so **no credit card** is required.

   Make sure the plan is `Free` in the creation screen before you click
   Create. The blueprint runs `sh ./startup.sh` before every deploy, which
   applies migrations and collects static files.

2. After the first successful deploy, the service URL will look like
   `https://perfect-foundation-backend.onrender.com`. Verify it:
   `curl https://perfect-foundation-backend.onrender.com/api/health/`

### Backend environment

The blueprint sets most variables automatically:

| Variable | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` | `config.settings.production` |
| `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` | auto-generated (set once) |
| `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `*` (tighten after adding a custom domain) |
| `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` | your Vercel origin, edit if you change it |
| `DATABASE_URL` | your Neon connection string |

### Create an admin user

The production database starts empty. From the Render dashboard, open
**Shell** for the backend service and run:

```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Optional: migrate your local data

To copy your local Postgres data to the production database:

```sh
docker compose exec db pg_dump -U school_admin perfect_foundation > dump.sql
# then in the Render shell:
cat dump.sql | python manage.py dbshell
```

(Simpler: use Render's dashboard DB import, or `pg_restore` from a
`pg_dump -Fc` archive.)

## 4. Deploy the frontend on Vercel

1. Vercel -> **Add New -> Project**, import the repo.
2. Project settings:
   - Framework preset: **Vite**
   - Root directory: `frontend`
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Output directory: `dist`
3. After deploy, edit `frontend/vercel.json` so `/api` rewrites point at your
   real Render URL, then redeploy:

   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/api/:path*", "destination": "https://perfect-foundation-backend.onrender.com/api/:path*" },
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. Visit your Vercel URL and sign in with the admin you created.

## 5. Custom domain (recommended)

- Vercel: add your domain to the frontend project.
- Render: add the same domain to the backend service (Settings -> Custom
  Domain), then update `DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS` and
  `DJANGO_CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` to the real domains (they already include
  your Vercel origin).

## Notes / limitations

- **Neon free tier**: 0.5 GB storage, no expiry, and the database sleeps
  after ~5 min of inactivity then wakes automatically on the next connection
  (the first query after idle is slow). Upgrade if you need more.
- **Render free web service**: sleeps after ~15 min idle and wakes on the
  next request (cold start takes ~30-60s).
- **Media files** are stored on the container's local disk (ephemeral).
  There are currently no file/image uploads in the app, so this is fine;
  add S3 if you introduce uploads later.
- **Email** uses Django's console backend. Wire a real SMTP backend
  (e.g. SendGrid) in production settings before relying on password reset.
