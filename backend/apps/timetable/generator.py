"""Greedy timetable generator.

Builds a weekly timetable for every section of a campus from existing
TeacherAssignments and SubjectOfferings:

- Each subject assigned to a section gets ``lessons_per_subject``
  periods per week.
- A section can only be in one place at a time; a teacher cannot teach
  two sections at once. The database-level unique constraints mirror
  these rules, and the in-memory busy map is overlap-aware: a slot is
  free only if it does not overlap any already-booked period for that
  resource on the same day (periods may share wall-clock time).
- Subjects are interleaved and slot order is rotated per lesson so the
  schedule spreads instead of clustering.

Unplaceable lessons (e.g. a teacher overloaded beyond capacity) are
reported back rather than failing the whole run.
